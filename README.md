This project leverages the powerful combination of ``Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`` and ``AutoEncoder-Decoder`` with a ``Siamese Network`` architecture to address the challenging task of image similarity detection. 

Our approach utilizes the depth and efficiency of CNNs to extract and process intricate visual features from images. Simultaneously, the AutoEncoder-Decoder framework is employed to accurately encode and decode these features, enabling the system to identify and compare subtle similarities between different images.
